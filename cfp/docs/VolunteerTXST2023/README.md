# Volunteer at Texas State University 2023

Professor Gregory Lakomski is someone who I look up to, and keep up with regularly.
He asked me to present to his Computer Architecture class, as well as the Fundamentals of Algorithic Design and Analysis classes.
Presenting to his classes is something I enjoy doing every semester, as a means to give back to my alma mater and the students who sit in the seats I once did several years back.
These slides are what I used to inspire, motivate, and share my many learnings along the way.
