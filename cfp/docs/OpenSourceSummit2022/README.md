# Computer Vision to Secure your Surroundings with AI/ML Solution Built using Open Source Tools at the Edge

Fast, low-cost edge compute is supporting the growth of IoT, AI and Computer Vision (CV) based solutions in several fields including smart city/home. Security solutions aiding situational awareness have benefits in keeping assets and the public safe. 

However, these solutions are increasingly difficult to develop & deploy due to resource constraints, hardware costs, and high inference loads on the edge device. Our team developed a CV based Security as a Service Smart City Solution using AI/ML. This solution provides a framework and processing pipeline for deploying AI-assisted, multi-camera Smart City Solution of vehicular and walkway traffic.

The Open Source software leveraged includes: GStreamer multimedia framework, Intel Distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit, Angular UI using VideoJS, Grafana map to depict edge device locations, PostgreSQL, EdgeX Foundry as an optional listener for inference results. The solution uses a containerized microservice-based architecture.

This presentation walks through the learnings and challenges encountered during the design and implementation of this unique solution for AI at the edge for a Security as a Service solution. We will also discuss the ethical concerns that drive our moral compass in developing these types of CV solutions.
